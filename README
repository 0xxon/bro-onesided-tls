This directory contains test that check the behavior of Bro when exposed to
unidirectional TLS traffic. Test cases use the standard testing framework
used for Bro; use btest (https://www.bro.org/sphinx/components/btest/README.html)
to run the test.

Test results are positive, parsing one-sided TLS connections with Bro works as long
as no other problems (like re-ordered packets) occur.
